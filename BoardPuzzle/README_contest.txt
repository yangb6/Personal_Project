HOMEWORK 6: BATTLESHIP CONTEST


NAME:  < BingYang >



COLLABORATORS AND OTHER RESOURCES:
First, I asked my classmates Yushi Xiao and Zhuoyi Li for some problem about homework_6.
Second, in the lab class, Charles  give me some helpful suggestions and help me to solve some problems about the homework_6. I feel grateful for their job. Thanks.
Third, I used the google to search some information about the recursion.
Finally, I also use the website cplusplus.com for some information.



DESCRIPTION OF ANY PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS/OPTIMIZATIONS:
(please be concise!)
1.I use a bool vector to record the change of each cells so that it may improve the speed.
2.I make a little change about the function to delete same solutions.




DESCRIBE INTERESTING NEW PUZZLES YOU CREATED:



SUMMARY OF YOUR PERFORMANCE ON ALL PUZZLES:
# of solutions & approximate wall clock running time for different
puzzles for a single solution or all solutions.
Actually, My program would find all solutions no matter the requirement is for one solution or all solutions.And if we just need to output the solution, then it would select the first solution from all solutions.

From puzzle 1 to puzzle 6, my program would take 1 or 2 seconds to get the solutions.
Puzzle 7 would take me about 5 minutes to get the Answer.
But It would take about one and half hour to get the solutions for puzzle 8/9/10.(Obviously, it is not a good algorithm.)
